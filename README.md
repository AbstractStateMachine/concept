and let it communicate among each other through the concept of a reactor via callbacks.

To hold data objects and callbacks together forming a higher object the concept of a
module has been introduced too.

Start with following sequence of git branches:

1. concept-dataobject
2. concept-reactor
3. concept-reactor-threaded
4. concept-module
5. concept-reflection
 
Other git branches are used for temporary tests!
